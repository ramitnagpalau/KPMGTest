# The Situation
A developer has approached you with the source code to their new app. The new app is a website written in ReactJS and is ready to be deployed. The dev has asked you to help get it ready.
They have told you they have documented how the app works in the DOC.md

# The task
Create a local run script that:
- Installs any dependancies
- Starts a development server
- Include any new relevant information into the DOC.md

Create a build script that:
- Installs any dependancies
- Runs unit tests
- Creates a production build
- Takes the build and creates a compressed archive
- Include any new relevant information into the DOC.md

Plan and be ready to discuss how this could be implemented into a Jenkins build

# Requirements
- Fork this repo and commit your changes to the fork
- The scripts can run on an OS of your choice
- You can use any language or tools you would like
- Scripts should tell the user what they are doing
- Add comments to scripts where helpful
- Limit time spent on the task to 2-3 hours
- Anything you don't have a chance to complete mention in the readme and we can discuss more
